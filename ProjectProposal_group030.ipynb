    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's society, people's beliefs and behaviors are generally influenced by social media. Social media is set up in a way that allows users to stay connected with \"friends\" and \"followers\", as well as suggest relevant content that the users would be interested in. TikTok has been observed to be the most popular among younger demographics and its recent boost in popularity suggests that it must also have some sort of impact as a social media platform. Given the current events surrounding the 2020 Presidential Election, we wanted to research the relationship between partisan bias in the election and TikTok videos featured on users' \"For You\" page. We have also seen the President take action in an attempt to ban TikTok due to its affiliation with China, so we are curious how this has had an affect as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that TikTok, being a relatively new platform, has a larger demographic among younger age groups. Additionally, from our own experience with TikTok, we have seen a general rise in politically-oriented videos that are meant for both entertainment and education due to the recent election. This information is important to understand how social media, and the rise of TikTok specifically, can influence the political beliefs and behaviors of users. According to articles we researched relating to TikTok's influence specifically, we see that political activism has, in fact, increased among its demographic, namely teenagers and young adults.\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For data, we plan to use TikTok scrapers from GitHub and TikTok API to receive data from the descriptions of specific TikToks that are relevant to the current political climate. Along with that, we plan to use publicly available datasets to monitor the 2020 Election Forecast and Donald Trump approval ratings. The variables we will be considering are trending videos and the hashtags that are associated with it, the number of comments and sentiment of words inside the comments, number of likes, hashtags, duets, views and like to view ratio for specific politically associated TikToks. These variables are to be connected with the overall approval ratings of Donald Trump and the expected voting average for each presidential candidate. The TikTok data using the TikTok scrapers from GitHub and the Election and presidential approval rating data would need to be organized to follow the tidy data format. For observations, we would connect the rise in popularity of political TikToks along with the change of the election forecast. "

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We plan to use TikTok for Developers, which is a public API and free to use. We also plan to use scrapers found on Github, which is free to use and public. There should not be any privacy concerns regarding our datasets as we plan to follow Tiktokâ€™s privacy policy regarding the information we use as stated in https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy?lang=en. Regarding data we collect online, there should not be any privacy concerns as the resources we gather are public sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding potential biases, since there is no way to eliminate all biases in our datasets, the potential biases include the sources itself from which we gather our information. Those sources themselves could be biased and lean towards one political identity. We believe that although this is unavoidable, it will not deem problematic as we would be gathering data pertaining that is inclusive of political identities. Another bias could be that using views, comments, likes, hashtags, etc would not be a good metric of the actual popularity and approval of the TikTok. Another possible bias could be that tiktok reflects the voting biases of the generation rather than shaping it. I donâ€™t think there is a way to tell if TikTok shapes voting tendencies of the younger demographic or if the younger demographicâ€™s voting tendencies shapes TikTok. We will handle issues that weâ€™ve identified on potential biases by using specific metrics that reflect the actual popularity of TikTok and its relationship to partisan bias."
